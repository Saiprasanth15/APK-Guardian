## Motivation/Application:  
Privacy (useful to prevent cyber-attacks)
## Objective: 
Detecting malware in the APK files based on the permissions they ask for in their manifest file.
## Tools/technologies used: 
WEKA, Flask, Visual Studio Code
## Algorithms/concepts: 
SVM, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, and feature selection methods.
## Learning outcomes: 
APK files internal working, various feature selection methods, and different algorithms in algorithms
## Duration: 
Four months
## Procedure and Impact created:
1) Engineered a web-based application for the detection of malware within APK files through a comprehensive analysis of the permissions specified in the manifest file, attained 83.7% accuracy and 82 F1-Score with the KNN algorithm and SFS method.

2) Boosted malware detection and improved efficiency by providing a 60% faster and more automated method compared to traditional manual analysis, resulting in improved user retention.
